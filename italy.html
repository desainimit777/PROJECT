      <div class="india_desc">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbspAs the birthplace of the Roman Empire and the Renaissance, it's not surprising that Italy should be so rich in masterpieces of art and architecture, or that it should have more UNESCO World Heritage cultural sites than any other country in the world. But Italy's top attractions for tourists are not all art and architecture; the country is blessed with lakes, mountains, and a dramatic coastline that give it outstanding natural attractions, as well. This list of top places to visit is only the beginning of outstanding things to see and do in Italy.

                <b>Formerly the capital of the Roman Empire, Rome today is the government seat and capital city of Italy. Located in the country’s central region of Lazio, Rome is a vast and complex city that is both historic and modern at the same time. Best known for housing ancient Roman structures and the Vatican City, Rome has endured for more than 2,500 years as an important center for culture, power and religion. From ancient romantic plazas to stunning cathedrals and Renaissance architecture, there is so much to see and do in Rome, that it could take months or even years to see it all.</b>

       <br><br><br> <b>Best time to visit:</b> &nbspNovember to February<br><br><br>
        <b>How to reach :</b>
        
            <br><br><b>By air:</b>&nbsp The main airport is Leonardo da Vinci in Fiumicino, about 30 kilometres southwest of the city. The other airport is Ciampino, where most domestic, and some international flights arrive. It lies about 15 kilometres southeast of the city. 
			A number of airlines connect India to Rome – from Air India and Air France to British Airways and Lufthansa, you can choose a carrier based upon your budget and convenience.
			You can easily get a bus from the airport that will drop you to a stop close to your hotel or the central station in less than an hour. The buses are comfortable and cheaper than taxis. There’s also the Leonardo Express train that will take you from the airport into the main city. Stop by at the Information Centre and ask for the stop closest to your destination.

            <br><br><b>By rail:</b>&nbsp Rome is well connected by rail to all the major cities in Italy and Europe. The main railway station is Roma Termini. If you plan to travel to towns outside of Rome, it would be best to book a seat beforehand rather than wait in queues at the station. Advance bookings also turn out to be cheaper. A good alternative would be to buy a Eurail Pass before you leave, but remember that just having the pass does not guarantee you a seat in the coach. You will have to go and make a reservation at the station at least a day before you plan to travel.

            <br><br><b>By road:</b>&nbsp The main road connecting Rome to the north and south of Italy is the Autostrada del Sole, which connects with the ring road circling the city. If you plan to drive anywhere in Italy, you will require an international driving licence.

            <br><br><br><b>Attractions:</b> The Colosseum, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, the Vatican Museum and Sistine Chapel, and the Borghese Museum.

           <br> <br><br><b>Average Temperature:</b> 9 to 31 degree celsius

                <b>One of the best places to visit in Italy, Venice is a unique city in that is built upon a lagoon surrounded by the Adriatic Sea. Located in northeastern Italy, Venice is an archipelago of 118 islands all connected by hundreds of beautiful bridges and scenic canals. Of the canals, the Grand Canal is most famous and divides the city into two sections. Picturesque waterways and historic architecture make Venice one of the most romantic cities in the world. Venice is often crowded but well worth visiting to see its magnificent landmarks like Saint Mark’s Square and Basilica, Doge’s Palace and Rialto Bridge. One of the most popular things to do is to take a gondola ride along one of its many canals.</b>

       <br><br><br> <b>Best time to visit:</b> &nbspApril, May, September, and October. <br><br><br>
        <b>How to reach :</b>
        
            <br><br><b>By air:</b>&nbsp You can directly reach Venice by air, car and train. You land at the Marco Polo Venice Airport which is the international airport. The terminal is well connected to the rest of the world after which you can avail various bus services from the airport to the city.

            <br><br><b>By rail:</b>&nbsp The Santa Lucia Station is located within the town of Venice and is the main mode of transport that is often used by people to travel to different cities in Europe. The terminal is well-linked with not just the Italian cities like Rome, Milan, Florence and Padua but other European cities like Austria, Germany, Paris and London (via the most popular train, the Orient Express). Note that advance bookings are cheaper and you might want to buy a Eurail Pass that offers great deals but make sure you make a reservation for your desired departure time at the station at least a day before you travel.

			Once you reach at the station, you can hire a private boat or a waterbus (the most common and economic mode of transport) that will take you to your hotel via waters of Grand Canal. This can be a great experience to feel the city up-close.
            
			<br><br><b>By road:</b>&nbsp f you plan to reach Venice by bus, note that the parking of the bus and the only bus station in Venice is Piazzale Roma. Once you reach here, you need to take the water transport (which is closely located) to reach the main town or your place of interest. You can follow Autostrada 4, A13 and SS11 which are the major routes to Venice from different parts of Italy.

            <br><br><br><b>Attractions:</b><br><br>Wander along the canals, take a gondola ride through the city, see St. Mark’s Square, walk across the Rialto Bridge, and visit the Doges’ Palace and Saint Mark’s Basilica.

                <b>One of Italy’s most visited tourist destinations, Pompeii is a famous Roman city which was buried under several feet of volcanic ash for nearly 1,700 years after the cataclysmic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. Excavation of Pompeii began in 1748, and the site is yet to be totally unearthed. The site is located near the modern city of Naples. A tour of Pompeii offers a fascinating insight into the everyday life of the ancient Roman world. Visitors can walk along the ancient streets to see the remains of bakeries, brothels and baths.</b>

       <br><br><br> <b>Best time to visit:</b> &nbspOctober to February<br><br><br>
        <b>How to reach :</b>
        
            <br><br><b>By air:</b>&nbsp Pompeii does not have an airport. A flight has to be taken to Naples or Rome, and then a train or bus to reach Pompeii.

            <br><br><b>By rail:</b>&nbspThe rail would be the best way to reach Pompeii. You can get on the Circumvesuviana Napoli-Sorrento line from either Naples or Sorrento and get off at Pompeii Scavi. If you're coming from Rome, you can get on at the Termini station, the tickets costs around EUR 11. You can also get on a local train from Salerno. You can keep your bags at the station for a small fee. There is a Tourist Information Office close to the Pompeii Scavi station.

            <br><br><b>By road:</b>&nbspYou can hire a car and drive down from neighbouring cities, but you will have to deal with the heavy traffic near the modern city of Pompeii. Parking can also be a hassle at times.Bus services from Naples are organised by SITA. Buses run frequently and the route is quite nice. The cost is similar to the train ticket.

            <br><br><br><b>Attractions:</b> Scavi di Pompeii (Excavations of Pompeii), Sanctuary of the Madonna of the Rosary, Villa dei Misteri, Forum, Teatro Grande.
           <br> <br><br><b>Average Temperature:</b> 24 to 34 degree celsius

                <b>Situated in Italy’s southwestern region of Campania, the Amalfi Coast is known for its extraordinary beauty that makes it one of Italy’s top tourist destinations. Stretching 30 miles along the southern side of the Sorrento Peninsula, the Amalfi Coast is prized for its picturesque coastline that features shimmering bays, craggy cliffs, lemon tree gardens, multicolored villas and ritzy resorts. One of the most romantic and posh towns along the Amalfi Coast is Positano with its beautiful pebbled beaches, pastel houses and scenic mountains. One of the larger towns, Amalfi, features lovely plazas lined with restaurants while the town of Ravello is favored for its beautiful villas of gardens and art works.</b>

       <br><br><br> <b>Best time to visit:</b> &nbsp;April to October<br><br><br>
        <b>How to reach :</b>
        
            <br><br><b>By air:</b>&nbsp The closest international airport to the Amalfi coast is in Naples (the Capodichino airport), but many people prefer to fly into Rome, as it's cheaper.

            <br><br><b>By rail:</b>&nbspTraveling on Trenitalia, Italy’s national train company, is the best for those who can’t stomach a sea commute. Their Freccia Rossa trains from Napoli Centrale to Sorrento are the most direct and efficient. Once in Sorrento, catch a bus to your destination, as many companies like Sitabus depart regularly from the city’s stations. Those traveling from Rome or Naples can opt for one of the new economical shuttle sharing systems like Positano Shuttle. It leaves from both international airports and deposits travelers directly in Positano.

            <br><br><b>By road:</b>&nbsp For many, traveling by road is still the most romantic and independent way to get from one destination to another. You can rent a car at either international airports in Rome or Naples, or opt for something more lavish from the Positano Car Service. Their fleet of large and small luxury vehicles will ensure you’re the most stylish tourist on the road.

            <br><br><br><b>Attractions:</b> Visit the towns on the Amalfi Coast such as Positano, Amalfi, and Salerno. You can get around using public transportation (the SITA buses) but in our experience, we were left stranded on multiple occasions, making bus travel in Italy a nightmare. After our experience, we would recommend paying the extra money and hiring a driver.
           <br> <br><br><b>Average Temperature:</b> 13 degree celsius to 30 degree celsius.
