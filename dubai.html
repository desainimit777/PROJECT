      <div class="india_desc">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbspGlitzy Dubai is the United Arab Emirates' holiday hot spot. This city of high-rises and shopping malls has transformed itself from a desert outpost to a destination du-jour, where tourists flock for sales bargains, sunshine, and family fun. Dubai is famous for sightseeing attractions such as the Burj Khalifa (the world's tallest building) and shopping malls that come complete with mammoth aquariums and indoor ski slopes.

        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbspBut this city has many cultural highlights and things to do, as well as all the glamorous modern add-ons. Take a wander around the Bastakia district, and you'll discover the Dubai of old, then cruise along Dubai Creek in a traditional dhow, and you'll soon realize there's more to this city than its flashy veneer. Learn more about the best places to visit with our list of the top attractions in Dubai.
