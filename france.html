      <div class="india_desc">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor more than two decades, France has reigned as the world’s most popular tourist destination, receiving 82 million foreign tourists annual. Travelers from all over the world are drawn to France’s sophisticated culture, exquisite cuisine, fine wines, romantic chateaux and picturesque countryside.Many people immediately picture Paris when they think of France. Whilst the country’s capital is a beautiful city filled with neoclassical architecture and some of the country’s most recognizable monuments (think the Eiffel Tower), there’s a lot more to see around the country than just one city.
        <br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbspTry the D-Day landing beaches in Normandy on for size or the Germanic culture in the Alsace region. Visit the Loire Valley for castles and vineyards, or Brittany for its earthy Celtic culture. For more wine, there’s the globally renowned Bordeaux region – famous for you know what. There are the French Alps, with Europe’s highest peak Mont Blanc to visit. In the south, there’s the endless charm of the French Riviera, including Saint-Tropez. There’s a lot to fit in, but here are the best places to visit in France.
